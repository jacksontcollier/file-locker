This is a test message for the cbcmac-tag program.
cbcmac-tag will build a tag for a give file (message)
cbcmac-validate Will validate a tag for a given file and tag. The results of
this program should be printed to standard out as either True (validates) or
False (does not validate).

These executables should take the following argument flags:
-k <key file> : required, specifies a file storing a valid Aes key as a hex
encoded string.

-m <message file> : required, specifies the path of the message file is being
store.

-t <output file> : required, specifies the path of the tag file, either as
output for the cbcmac-tag or as an input for cbcmac-validate.
